# HACKING.md

A `HACKING.md` file is a document with technical information that provides guidance for contributors to **understand**, and to **make changes** to a project.

I have created a number of `HACKING.md` files for a number of different purposes.

These purpose specific `HACKING.md` files can also be imported into an `AGENTS.md` file.

Below is a list of _my_ different (purpose specific) `HACKING.md` files:
